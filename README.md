# MultiwayImputation
This repository contains code to perform and illustrate BAMITA: Bayesian multiple imputation for tensor arrays (i.e., multiway data), developed by Ziren Jiang.  The file 'Bayesian_Tensor_Imputation_Functions.R' is an R script containing functions to perform the methods.  'Bayesian_Tensor_Imputation_Guide.html' is an illustrative tutorial to generate tensor data and impute missing values using the functions, generated by the corresponding Rmarkdown document.
